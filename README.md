# Super AI Solidity Smart Contract Workshop

Today, I participated in Blockchain and Smart Contract workshop in the [Super AI Engineer development program 2022](https://superai.aiat.or.th/) by the instructor [Asst. Prof. Warodom Werapun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/werapun/). Althought I probably made a lot of mistakes, It was very fun session and was the first time I learn how to write Smart Contracts using Solididy. I also minted my own Norapat token, deployed to Web3 test-net, and imported into my Metamask wallet.
